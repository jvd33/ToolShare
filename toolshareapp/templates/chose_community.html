            Changing a community will move all your tools to a new community, cancel all future reservations on any of your tools (and alert the borrowers),
            and sends a message to any borrower that currently has a tool of yours. You may need to coordinate with any current borrowers of your tools.
        </h4>
        <h4>
            A community is for sharing tools within a certain zone. Choose a community that fits your location so that you can share tools easily between your
            house or within nearby sheds.
        </h4>
        <h4>
            If you want to create a new community make sure it is a large enough zone that people want to join it. Good community zones are neighborhoods,
            schools, and workplaces.
