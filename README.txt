**************************************************************************

Known Bugs and Disclaimers:

1.) For nearly every form on the site, all fields are deleted if any invalid data is in the fields upon submission. Other forms on the site don’t have this behavior.

2.) Inconsistent warning messages: For removing a message, the warning message is an alert popup, but for banning users, the warning message is a popup built into the page.

3.) Joining a community when logging in the first time brings you to the URL 127.0.0.1:8000/toolshare/select, but changing communities at any other time (after logging in, for instance) brings you to the URL 127.0.0.1:8000/toolshare/change_community with an identical page. A user can still get to 127.0.0.1:8000/toolshare/select by typing it into the URL bar after logging in the first time.

4.) "Edit my info" (next to "Log Out") navigates to a broken page.

5.) Some forms don't notify you of the exact problem with the fields if they're filled in incorrectly, or if they're left blank.

6.) Usernames are case sensitive on login.

7.) A tool can be edited, including moving it from home to shed or vice versa, after someone requests to borrow it.

8.) Reservation/blackout dates can be set before the current date.

9.) When a blackout date is being set, you will be redirected to the page that is used for setting up a reservation. Fill out the fields for the times when you don't anyone else to be using the tool. Unfortunately, the blackout dates cannot be edited once you accept them.

10.) For convenience, the list of users appears at the bottom of the page when searching for tools. That way, a user can be found by searching for a tool that the user has.

11.) Clicking “Home” on the top nav bar is not always a required step. The top nav bar should always be there, and all options from the nav bar should be accessible from every page, but if not, going to the home screen guarantees this behavior.
